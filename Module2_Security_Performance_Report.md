# Module 2: Security & Performance Deep Dive

## Security Issues in `before/MainActivity.java`
1. **Hardcoded Credentials:**
   - Usernames and passwords are hardcoded in the source code (e.g., `"user1:pass1"`).
2. **Hardcoded API Key:**
   - Sensitive API key (`"12345-SECRET-KEY"`) is present in the code.
3. **No Input Validation:**
   - No checks or validation for user input or data.
4. **No Secure Storage:**
   - Sensitive data is not stored securely (should use Android Keystore or encrypted storage).
5. **No Obfuscation or Protection:**
   - Code is not obfuscated, making it easy to reverse-engineer secrets.

## Performance Bottlenecks in `before/MainActivity.java`
1. **Inefficient Nested Loop:**
   - The inner loop (`for (int j = 0; j < 10000; j++)`) inside the UI creation loop causes unnecessary computation and UI lag.
2. **Large, Monolithic Method:**
   - All logic is in `onCreate`, making it hard to optimize or parallelize.

## How the `after` Code Fixes These Issues
### Security Improvements
- **No Hardcoded Credentials or API Keys:**
  - User data is generic (e.g., `"User 1"`), and no secrets are present in the code.
- **No Sensitive Data in Code:**
  - All sensitive information is removed.
- **Ready for Secure Storage:**
  - The code is modular and ready for secure data handling if needed.
- **Documentation and Structure:**
  - Javadoc comments clarify intent and usage, reducing accidental misuse.
- **Lint Configuration:**
  - The `lint.xml` file enforces rules against hardcoded text and insecure random usage.

### Performance Improvements
- **No Inefficient Loops:**
  - The inner loop is removed; only necessary UI logic is performed.
- **Modular Methods:**
  - UI creation is split into small, reusable methods, improving maintainability and performance.
