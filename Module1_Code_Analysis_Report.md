# Module 1: AI Code Analysis Foundations

## Messy Function Review (`before/MainActivity.java`)

### Key Issues Identified
- **Complexity:**
  - The `onCreate` method does too much: UI setup, data definition, logic, and view creation all in one place.
  - The `doEverythingBadly` method is a placeholder for a massive, unstructured block of code (simulated with deeply nested loops).
- **Security:**
  - Hardcoded credentials (`"user1:pass1"`, etc.) and a hardcoded API key (`"12345-SECRET-KEY"`) are present in the code.
- **Performance:**
  - Inefficient inner loop (`for (int j = 0; j < 10000; j++)`) inside the main UI loop, causing unnecessary computation.
- **Bugs/Bad Practices:**
  - No error handling or input validation.
  - No separation of concerns (UI, data, and logic are mixed).
  - No documentation or comments.
  - Inconsistent code style (e.g., inline if/else, no spacing).
  - No use of constants or resource files for strings/colors.

## Code Health Audit
- **Maintainability:** Low (everything is in one place, hard to extend or test).
- **Readability:** Poor (no comments, unclear variable names, no structure).
- **Modularity:** None (no helper methods, all logic in `onCreate`).
- **Security:** Poor (hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no secure storage).
- **Performance:** Poor (unnecessary nested loops).
- **Style Consistency:** None (mixed formatting, no linting).

## Code Health Roadmap (Prioritized)
1. **Security:** Remove hardcoded credentials and API keys; use secure storage or configuration.
2. **Performance:** Remove unnecessary loops and optimize UI creation.
3. **Readability & Maintainability:**
   - Extract methods for UI setup, data handling, and view creation.
   - Add documentation and comments.
   - Use consistent code style and formatting.
4. **Modularity:**
   - Separate concerns (data, UI, logic).
   - Use constants/resources for strings and colors.
5. **Style & Linting:**
   - Set up linting and formatting tools.
