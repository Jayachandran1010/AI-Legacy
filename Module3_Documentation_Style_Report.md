# Module 3: Documentation & Code Style

## Function Documentation in `after/MainActivity.java`

### Example Javadoc Comments

```java
/**
 * MainActivity displays a list of users in a vertical LinearLayout.
 * Demonstrates clean code, security, and performance best practices.
 */
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
    ...
    /**
     * Returns a list of user display names (no credentials or secrets).
     * @return List of user names
     */
    private List<String> getUserList() { ... }

    /**
     * Creates the main screen with a scrollable list of users.
     * @param items List of user names
     * @return ScrollView containing the list
     */
    private ScrollView createListScreen(List<String> items) { ... }

    /**
     * Creates a styled TextView for a user.
     * @param name User name
     * @param index Index for color alternation
     * @return TextView
     */
    private TextView createUserTextView(String name, int index) { ... }
}
```

- All major functions are documented with clear Javadoc, describing parameters, return values, and purpose.
- The class itself is documented to clarify its role and best practices.

## Style & Linting Improvements
- **Consistent Formatting:**
  - Indentation, spacing, and braces follow standard Java conventions.
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Methods and variables use descriptive, camelCase names.
- **Lint Configuration:**
  - The `after/lint.xml` file enforces rules against hardcoded text, insecure random usage, and unused resources.
- **No Magic Numbers or Strings:**
  - All user data is generic and safe; no hardcoded secrets.

---

## Technical Debt Analysis (`before/MainActivity.java`)
- **Lack of Documentation:**
  - No comments or Javadoc, making the code hard to understand and maintain.
- **Inconsistent Style:**
  - Mixed formatting, inline if/else, and poor readability.
- **Monolithic Methods:**
  - All logic is in one place, making it hard to test or extend.
- **Security and Performance Issues:**
  - Hardcoded secrets, inefficient loops, and no error handling.
- **No Linting or Style Enforcement:**
  - No configuration to enforce code quality or consistency.
